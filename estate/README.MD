# 🏠 EstateHub

EstateHub is a real estate listing web application built with the Django framework. It aims to simplify and improve the house rental process in Nigeria by providing a transparent and easy-to-use platform for property owners to list their properties and for renters to find available accommodation.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In Nigeria, renting a house is often a frustrating and stressful experience. From dealing with dishonest agents to traveling long distances without reliable information, the process lacks transparency, efficiency, and trust. EstateHub seeks to solve this by bringing property listings online and allowing seamless connections between landlords and prospective tenants.
